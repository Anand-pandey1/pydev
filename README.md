## ✅ 5. Variables in Python


```python
name = "Alice"     # str
age = 25           # int
height = 5.9       # float
is_cool = True     # bool

print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_cool)
```

## ✅ Explanation:

<b>Strings</b> (str) store text.

Integers (int) store whole numbers.

Floats (float) store decimal numbers.

Booleans (bool) store True or False.

## <B> You can print multiple variables:</b>

```python
print(name, age, height, is_cool)

```

## ✅ 6. Naming Rules
<b>
 ~ Use letters, numbers, and underscores (_)

    ~ Cannot start with a number

    ~ Use snake_case by convention: user_name, total_score
</b>

> ## print values with additional text
```python

name = "Alice"
age = 25    
print("My name is ",name," and i am ",age," years old")

```

Whether you are a student (boolean)

## ✅task 2:
